Short term:
* Add anti-weighting if a possible answer is in the search query. (re: pepsi question)
* Partial natural language processing to create better queries.
* Search for "a possible answer" and a+possible+answer, but weight "a possible answer" more.
* Leverage google suggest
* XML question databases
* Category selection

Long term:
* Proper natural language processing.
